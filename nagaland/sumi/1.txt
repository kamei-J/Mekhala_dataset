design: bold red base with horizontal black lines, evenly spaced, running across the entire fabric. These lines create a rhythmic, grid-like layout. The bottom layer is black with colorful zigzag embroideryâ€”red, yellow, green, and white.

description: These zigzags are sharply defined and alternate in a repeated triangular pattern, possibly symbolizing spears, mountains, or protection.
