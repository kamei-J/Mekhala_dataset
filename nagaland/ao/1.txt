design: it has red and black stripes with white cowrie shell in the middle
description: The circular pattern made from cowrie shells in the center is a notable feature seen on the "Tsüngkotepsü", a warrior shawl traditionally worn by Ao warriors who had taken the heads of enemies in battle or had performed certain feats of valor. It remains a symbol of high honor and cultural pride.
