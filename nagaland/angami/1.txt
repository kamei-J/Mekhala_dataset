design: primary base color is deep black, earthy brown, neon yellow-green, and hints of multi-colored threads creating a subtle yet striking contrast.
On one end of the shawl, you see a set of vertical stripes running parallelâ€”made up of alternating brown and vibrant yellow-green lines

description: Deep black, symbolizing strength, dignity, and resilience. These stripes are asymmetrically placed, indicating a possible rank, age, or marital status, or simply serving as a visual identity of the tribe. The minimalistic yet meaningful design reflects the pragmatic and elegant lifestyle of Angami women. The use of earthy tones mixed with luminous threads is symbolic of the Angami connection to nature and spirituality.
